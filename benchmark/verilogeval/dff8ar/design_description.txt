I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  areset
 - input  d      (8 bits)
 - output q      (8 bits)

The module should include 8 D flip-flops with active high asynchronous
reset. The output should be reset to 0. All DFFs should be triggered by
the positive edge of clk.

Give me the complete code.

module TopModule (
  input clk,
  input [7:0] d,
  input areset,
  output reg [7:0] q
);
